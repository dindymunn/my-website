  <h1>Curtains - Summer 2019</h1>
  <p>TIt is said behind the curtain of every great man is a woman
But is seems to me that it is the woman that is great
My struggle isn’t my own,
It’s every woman’s.
A man should get to stand between me and who I could be?

That’s our reality
That is the world we were born into
The world we are told to wear
But it is us, and I, and you that make a choice.
Do we let the world dress us?

Because I think it real fucking unfair.
Because I very well know I can dress myself
And I pull up my own boots
And the men I have left behind are boys who didn’t like it when I told them I could do it myself. 

Because I am not someone else’s precious flower
To simply pick and think lovely of and throw away when my petals wilt

I grew these legs to stand on
And my arms are to reach for goals they think we cannot achieve

Rip away the fabric of beliefs that others drape us in.
Because that fabric is not ours
It’s manufactured by a generation of men who think us best in pink
Behind secretary desks and sealed lips

-- in suits who think we shouldn’t get to decide what happens to the bodies that are our own.
-- with power who think our identities are solely determined by a capital F or M on a piece of paper. 

To weave my own cloth.
That is the choice our generation is making
To weave an identity that is our own
Completely at odds with the children they thought they raised.

A deeply rooted flower grows back.
So even when they pick our petals
And try to cut our stem for themselves
Hold strong, believe deeply, root your-self.
Because you and I and us “women-folk”
-- perfectly capable of pulling back the curtain.
