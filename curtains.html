  <h1>Curtains - Summer 2019</h1>
  <p>It is said behind the curtain of every great man is a woman
<p>But is seems to me that it is the woman that is great
<p>My struggle isn’t my own,
<p>It’s every woman’s.
<p>A man should get to stand between me and who I could be?

<p>That’s our reality
<p>That is the world we were born into
<p>The world we are told to wear
<p>But it is us, and I, and you that make a choice.
<p>Do we let the world dress us?

<p>Because I think it real fucking unfair.
<p>Because I very well know I can dress myself
<p>And I pull up my own boots
<p>And the men I have left behind are boys who didn’t like it when I told them I could do it myself. 

<p>Because I am not someone else’s precious flower
<p>To simply pick and think lovely of and throw away when my petals wilt

<p>I grew these legs to stand on
<p>And my arms are to reach for goals they think we cannot achieve

<p>Rip away the fabric of beliefs that others drape us in.
<p>Because that fabric is not ours
<p>It’s manufactured by a generation of men who think us best in pink
<p>Behind secretary desks and sealed lips

<p>-- in suits who think we shouldn’t get to decide what happens to the bodies that are our own.
<p>-- with power who think our identities are solely determined by a capital F or M on a piece of paper. 

<p>To weave my own cloth.
<p>That is the choice our generation is making
<p>To weave an identity that is our own
<p>Completely at odds with the children they thought they raised.

<p>A deeply rooted flower grows back.
<p>So even when they pick our petals
<p>And try to cut our stem for themselves
H<p>old strong, believe deeply, root your-self.
<p>Because you and I and us “women-folk”
<p>-- perfectly capable of pulling back the curtain.
