<h1>Curtains - Summer 2019</h1>

<p>It is said behind the curtain of every great man is a woman.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that it is the woman that is great.</p>
<p>My struggle isn’t my own,</p>
<p>It’s every woman’s.</p>
<p>A man should get to stand between me and who I could be?</p>

<p>That’s our reality.</p>
<p>That is the world we were born into.</p>
<p>The world we are told to wear.</p>
<p>But it is us, and I, and you that make a choice.</p>
<p>Do we let the world dress us?</p>

<p>Because I think it real fucking unfair.</p>
<p>Because I very well know I can dress myself,</p>
<p>And I pull up my own boots.</p>
<p>And the men I have left behind are boys who didn’t like it when I told them I could do it myself.</p>

<p>Because I am not someone else’s precious flower,</p>
<p>To simply pick and think lovely of and throw away when my petals wilt.</p>

<p>I grew these legs to stand on,</p>
<p>And my arms are to reach for goals they think we cannot achieve.</p>

<p>Rip away the fabric of beliefs that others drape us in.</p>
<p>Because that fabric is not ours.</p>
<p>It’s manufactured by a generation of men who think us best in pink,</p>
<p>Behind secretary desks and sealed lips,</p>
<p>-- in suits who think we shouldn’t get to decide what happens to the bodies that are our own,</p>
<p>-- with power who think our identities are solely determined by a capital F or M on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>To weave my own cloth.</p>
<p>That is the choice our generation is making,</p>
<p>To weave an identity that is our own,</p>
<p>Completely at odds with the children they thought they raised.</p>

<p>A deeply rooted flower grows back.</p>
<p>So even when they pick our petals,</p>
<p>And try to cut our stem for themselves,</p>
<p>Hold strong, believe deeply, root yourself.</p>
<p>Because you and I and us “women-folk,”</p>
<p>-- perfectly capable of pulling back the curtain.</p>
